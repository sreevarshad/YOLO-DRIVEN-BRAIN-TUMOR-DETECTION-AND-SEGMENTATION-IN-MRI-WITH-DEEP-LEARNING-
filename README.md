## Title of the Project
YOLO-Driven Brain Tumor Detection and Segmentation in MRI with Deep Learning
  
## About
Brain tumors are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, requiring early and accurate detection for effective treatment. Traditional diagnosis methods rely on MRI scans analyzed by radiologists, which can be time-consuming and prone to subjective interpretation. This project proposes a deep learning-based system that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and the YOLO (You Only Look Once) framework for real-time detection and segmentation of brain tumors in MRI scans. The project aims to improve diagnosis speed and accuracy while reducing human error.

The system processes MRI images using advanced image preprocessing techniques, extracts relevant features, and employs YOLOv5 and YOLOv7 models for tumor classification and segmentation. The proposed method classifies tumors into three major types—meningioma, glioma, and pituitary tumors—ensuring efficient and automated analysis.
